    A TaskQueue class that manages tasks in a separate thread.

    This class provides a simple way to queue tasks and execute them asynchronously
    using a single worker thread. Tasks added to the queue are functions that will
    be executed by the worker thread.

    Attributes:
        tasks (queue.Queue): A queue that stores the tasks to be executed.
        thread (threading.Thread): The worker thread that executes tasks from the queue.

    Methods:
        __init__(self): Initializes a new instance of the TaskQueue class, starts the worker thread.
        _worker(self): The worker method that runs in a separate thread and executes tasks from the queue.
        add_task(self, task): Adds a task to the queue for execution by the worker thread.
